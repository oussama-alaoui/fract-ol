Different color schemes (rotated and linear)
Smooth and linear coloring
Planned features
Calculate values with OpenCL
Selective anti-aliasing
Chunked rendering to buffer while moving around
Compiling and running
Run make. An executable will compile. Runs on OS X and Linux.

Run it with ./fractol [fractal]. Possible fractals are: mandelbrot, julia, burningship. Cycle color-schemes with 1-9 on the top row. Increase/decrease maximum iterations with * and / on the numpad.
